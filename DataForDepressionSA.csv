Danny Keane,"Guys this isn't something I usually speak about in public but I think it's such a good idea so that's the reason for this long post.  
Did anyone see the Roman Kemp documentary on BBC1 tonight called Our Silent Emergency? It covered quite a personal topic for me, Suicide. He did such a brilliant job raising awareness, to be honest it was pretty heartbreaking at times and brought on a few tears that's for sure. The higher percentage of Suicide in the world is Males and this is what it was focused on however I think this affects people of all ages and genders. I won't get into any personal details but I'm sure there's alot of people out there that have considered Suicide, know someone who has or maybe even have friends or family that they think are OK when really they may not be. 
The point of this post is to try and promote something he came up with and I think it's a great idea, it's called the double OK rule. Everyday we ask friends or family how they are or 'if they are OK?'. Usually it's just replied to with a simple yes before moving on with the rest of the conversation, but what if they're not OK?  Asking if they're are 'really OK' for a second time can have such a different outcome, when asked twice it can provoke a completely different reaction and get someone talking, possibly even saving someones life if they are feeling low or suicidal. 
With Mental Health issues currently at its highest ever due to the Pandemic I don't think the documentary could have been timed any better and it really covered so much. Simply asking twice could save someones life, surely it's worth taking the extra time to double check on someone you love right?  Come on guys we need to have each others backs here and what a simple way to do so. 
 So, are you really OK?  
The Double OK Rule ❤"

I am so very tired. I work 5 days a week for two full-time jobs totaling between 80-90 hours every week. Plus I pick up cleaning jobs on my off days. All because my father lost his job due to covid and because my sister is dealing with some pretty serious medical issues that make it so she is only able to work part-time. I don't mind working all of these hours, not really anyhow, what I do mind however is coming home and still having to not only make sure everyone is fed but also that the housework gets done and that bills are paid on time. I had today off from both jobs for the first time in forever and instead of resting, I spent it making appointments, doing yard work, paying bills, and all other not restful stuff. I'm so desperate for a break it isn't even funny.

Patty Snyder Taylor,"DEPRESSION TIPS:
Shower. Not a bath, a shower. Use water as hot or cold as you like. You don’t even need to wash. Just get in under the water and let it run over you for a while. Sit on the floor if you gotta.
Moisturize everything. Use whatever lotion you like. Unscented? Dollar store lotion? Fancy 48 hour lotion that makes you smell like a field of wildflowers? Use whatever you want, and use it all over your entire dermis. 
Put on clean, comfortable clothes. 
Put on your favorite underwear. Cute black lacy panties? Those ridiculous boxers you bought last christmas with candy cane hearts on the butt? Put them on.
Drink cold water. Use ice. If you want, add some mint or lemon for an extra boost. 
Clean something. Doesn’t have to be anything big. Organize one drawer of a desk. Wash five dirty dishes. Do a load of laundry. Scrub the bathroom sink. 
Blast music. Listen to something upbeat and dancey and loud, something that’s got lots of energy. Sing to it, dance to it, even if you suck at both.
Make food. Don’t just grab a granola bar to munch. Take the time and make food. Even if it’s ramen. Add something special to it, like a soft boiled egg or some veggies. Prepare food, it tastes way better, and you’ll feel like you accomplished something. 
Make something. Write a short story or a poem, draw a picture, color a picture, fold origami, crochet or knit, sculpt something out of clay, anything artistic. Even if you don’t think you’re good at it. Create. 
Go outside. Take a walk. Sit in the grass. Look at the clouds. Smell flowers. Put your hands in the dirt and feel the soil against your skin.
Call someone. Call a loved one, a friend, a family member, call a chat service if you have no one else to call. Talk to a stranger on the street. Have a conversation and listen to someone’s voice. If you can’t bring yourself to call, text or email or whatever, just have some social interaction with another person. Even if you don’t say much, listen to them. It helps.
Cuddle your pets if you have them/can cuddle them. Take pictures of them. Talk to them. Tell them how you feel, about your favorite movie, a new game coming out, anything. 
May seem small or silly to some, but this list keeps people alive.  
*** At your absolute best you won’t be good enough for the wrong people. But at your worst, you’ll still be worth it to the right ones. Remember that. Keep holding on. 
*** In case nobody has told you today I love you and you are worth your weight and then some in gold, so be kind to yourself and most of all keep pushing on!!!!
***People don’t fake depression.. they fake being ok. 
Find something to be grateful for! Make a gratitude list daily to remind yourself of what you have to be grateful for. "

My wife who We have known each other since very young ages  (4) I’m now 50 married for the past 17 years with two very awesome daughters 14-16 . About 12 years ago mental illness struck my wife and it has progressively gotten worse to the point it is effecting the children and myself as well ? A few weeks ago she thought she was being attacked by demons and spirits and she left the home . After I found out the extent it had affected our children I felt the best decision was to file for divorce while she had left the presence of the children ? I love and miss my wife deeply there is a emptyness among the home that seems to never fill . I completely understand this has to happen for the children sake . I’ve never hurt anyone to my knowledge the way I have had file this divorce is hurting everyone especially my wife I could never even imagine having to do this to someone . I know for myself my stomach is constantly in knots as if I have the flu . We are in a new town 4 years now so we don’t have a lot of friends especially with my work schedule there’s just no time especially with being Mr mom now . This is the absolute hardest thing I have ever had to do so far in my life ."

Bill Fendt,"Okay, some of you have heard my story about my now ex-wife.  Since I left her I started dating someone else.  I thought that she was the one for me.  She saved me from my misery and anguish of a life that I was living.   She was the light in my darkness.  She helped me so much everyday with me and also my kids.  While we were together my psychotic ex-wife constantly attacked me, her, my dad, her mom, her relatives, her friends, and even minor children.  She eventually wanted me out of her life due to what my ex-wife did and what she was doing to me.   She had me back in that same depression I was in when we were married still.  Now people keep telling me that I am better off without her.  That if she really loved me my crazy ex-wife wouldn't have been an issue.  Now I have resorted to living with my parents because not only has my ex-wife sabotaged my relationship with my last girlfriend but she's sabotaged practically every friendship I had.  Turning them all against me.   The few friends I have left I don't even know if I can trust them.   My last girlfriend wanted to get married shortly after I was divorced and by then I was done with marriage.   And she wanted more kids which I also didn't want.  So in a way it's good we split.  My problem is that I can't stop thinking about her.  It's making me crazy.  I want to do nothing but sleep and cry.   But since I'm here I don't want to show how I feel.   I just stuff it down deep inside like I've always done.  There's so much hatred and sadness in there screaming to come out.  I really don't know what to do about the thoughts I'm getting about her, about my ex-wife, about doing things I promised myself I wouldn't do again when my oldest was born.  But I'm not sure I can keep going on like this.   I try to hide my pain and keep it from my kids.  I don't need any more pain in my life.  I think aside from being done with marriage I think I'm done with relationships too.  Nothing but headaches for me.  I think I'm going to live the whole bachelor life.  I'm just so hurt and I want it to stop."

I want to see what it is I could do differently. But I'm coming up with nothing. I have already changed everything I've done. And trying to look at myself first. It hasn't helped. So what do I do now?

Benjamin Dzhurayev ,"I don’t understand. If it’s not seizers im suffering with, then what are these terrifying symptoms, I’ve been suffering with, on and off for the past three years now. I suddenly feel confused, I feel like I’m in a dream, I feel extremely strong deja vu take over my mind, everything feels like an illusion, I feel like about to not recognize my mom, I can’t tell if I’m dreaming or awake, I have completely random flashbacks to completely random memories that I didn’t even think I could still remember and it feels as if I’m about to wake up in that flashback. I get this feeling as if I haven’t been home in a really long while and I’m seeing my home for the first time in week. I’m not sure what the symptom is called. Everyone that I have been to for help has told me that it’s not seizures and I’m non epileptic. They tell me that these are just symptoms due to not getting enough sleep, not eating right and spending too many hours on my phone. I’m worried that I might of done some permanent damage to myself because I’ve been living an unhealthy lifestyle for three years now. Another really terrifying thing is, I can sometimes guess what someone is about to say and what is about to happen when I experience these symptoms from a poor lifestyle. It’s really horrifying and I don’t understand the connection. I don’t understand why that happens. Do these attacks raise a person intuition? I’m suffering so sever that I’m even questioning people if I might be dead and in hell and this suffering is my punishment.will switching to a healthy lifestyle really being me back to feeling healthy again? You don’t think four years of living unhealthy is too much and I might of done some permanent damage to myself, even tho I’ve been suffering for three years now, I still can’t stop living so unhealthy. But I really what to know tho, what are these “Symptoms” as all the doctors I’ve been to if they are not seizures, yet they match the description of the symptoms seizers? A part of me might of even created this deja vu to prevent me from shock.

David Steven Howard,"Since last summer, I am constantly seeing cyclists at junctions.  (Even at less busy times of the day) It is no coincidence.  Lately to prove my point, I keep changing my mind of the route I am walking and no matter what direction I take I always see cyclists at junctions. The world since last summer has changed and we are living in very strange times. I see what I'm going through a premonition of either I'll get hit by a cyclist at a junction or it will be the last thing I'll ever see before I die or I'm gonna witness a accident involving a cyclist at a junction. I can remember last year, before this became the norm I was nearly hit by a cyclist on a canal towpath, not too far away from a junction. This consistent viewing of cyclists at junctions is affecting me mentally. There is something strange happening. Am I overanalyzing this?"

Ann Teresa Fuller,"From a Tiktok post...
If the mountain feels too big today,
Then climb a hill instead.
If the morning brings you softness,
It's OK to stay in bed.
If the day ahead weighs heavy,
And your plans feel like a curse,
There's no shame in rearranging,
Don't make yourself feel worse.
If a shower stings like needles,
And your bath feels like you've drowned,
If you haven't washed your hair in days,
Don't throw away your crown.
The day is not a lifetime,
A rest is not defeat,
Don’t think of it as failure,
Just a quiet, kind retreat.
It's OK to take a moment,
From an anxious, fractured mind,
The world will not stop turning,
While you get realigned.
The mountain will still be there
If you want to try again,
You can climb it in your own time,
Just love yourself till then.

Kavya S,"Hi, 
How to deal with toxic loser syndrome? I constantly feel left out. I also feel I’m reaching no where in life. 
Thanks!"
David Steven Howard,My self esteem is low. I feel low and I feel like I can't change. I don't think I'll ever be able to live a normal happy life. I wish I hadn't neglected and been apathetic about my health. I feel like I've left it too late. I'm 50. I'm lacking motivation and confidence. I'm living in a state of apathy. I have a telephone call tomorrow regarding meds. But I have no faith in authorities. It's overwhelmed and the politics are useless.
Steve Brauman,"Being bedbound first at a hospital for one full week, and then at my mother's house and quickly recuperating I've been told with antibiotics and other medications from a crater wound in my rear-end for the passed three weeks ( one month collectively together) has me down.
    Nurse's home visits and stressed arguments between, all has me depressed with staying here away from my apartment and trying to deal with it all. Here I am a grown man of fifty-eight years old and having.to be laying in a bed most of the time and feeling like a damned captive in my mother's home (but being fed two.to three times away at least and taken to my doctor's appointments at least, carrying around a pee-bag I have to have because of a urinal operation). Having to rely on others is something I hate to do.
    But having to listen to the bitching at and the stressing out at is especially unpleasant. You know, it was doctors orders that I stay here if I didn't want to stay at the hospital. How does anybody else here have to deal with it, being depressed, without having to SNAP-OUT on everybody else (three other people) around you?"

Amber Gibson,Hello all! I’m a mom of two boys and a wife to a man who works 7 days a week 2nd shift. I very rarely get time to myself. I have family who is unwilling to help with my kids and very few friends. Most days I’m not even motivated to get a shower or even do something fun with my kids. House work some times gets put on the back burner because I just want to nap. It’s also been crippling to keeping a job because I’m not motivated enough to even work most of the time. It’s taken a toll on my life and my marriage. I haven’t actually been diagnosed with depression but very certain of it due the symptoms I have. What are some ways you all get yourselves motivated? Are there any tips dealing with depression on an every day basis?

It was the only healthy relationship I’ve ever been in and the only one that truly made me happy and she left, even after she promised she’d stay but she still left me. Why am I not good enough? Everything reminds me of her and I had my first ever breakdown when she broke up with me. I cried my eyes out and punched my walls and other things until my knuckles were bleeding. My parents think I’m faking my depression so I can get out of school work and getting a job even tho I tried to overdose twice. They don’t take it seriously which I don’t blame them tbh. When does the pain end?"

Jessica Campbell,1st post... I've dealt with depression since I was a kid. Fast forward  I fell in love last year tried to break down every wall I built around me.. tried to repair where I was damaged and I couldn't do it fast enough he left me... a week ago today I was speeding home to be with my boyfriend now I'm jus sitting in my car not even wanting to go in my own home cause he's not there n not coming back. Never tried so hard to be a better version of myself than I did with him. Jus wondering why I'm not worth the time it takes to heal.
Chelsea Skea,"Going through traumas that left me with the worst trust issues, I don’t trust a soul ever, I’ve pushed everyone in my life away because I don’t trust and assume the worst, ALWAYS. I’m left with no one but my family. I love them but I don’t ever really want to open up about my depression. I’ve pushed every friend I’ve ever had away, which I’ve noticed is so I could do it before they leave me. Does anyone else deal with similar issues? I just feel so lonely, especially now."
Sarah Mo,"I feel so lost... My ex betrayed me and left me after four years for sb I knew because I wanted children and he did not, just to get her pregnant within a few days. We were together till February and the baby is due in October. He was the only person I ever really loved and trusted and I just can't. I'm mostly no longer suicidal but feel my depression getting worse again. We live in a small town and have the same friends, our siblings are friends, I'm friends with his brothers and sisters. Ppl start to feel I should get over it and if there are parties now often he's invited and I am not as he's fine with seeing me while I can't hold myself together. I really hope for them to die which is just awful but I just can't help it. Idk why I'm writing all this, maybe I just needed to rant. I know I should let go and I know that I deserve better, yet I am blaming myself for everything all the time and I hate myself for not being able to just stop my feelings. Worst thing is I think I still love him and I am scared to death I always will"

Gary Jimenez Sr.,Does anyone struggle with connecting with people on a deeper level? I feel like my depression and bipolar are a major factor. Somedays I'm tough as nails. Somedays I wear my feelings on my sleeve. Somedays I'm needy. And somedays I don't need anyone. Somedays I'm kind. And somedays I'm cold. Just curious if anyone struggles with relationships.

Every hour before work I get a sore stomach and feel sick to the point I have called in a-bunch. Everyone is telling me not to quit because it is such an easy job and I get to stay home. It is easy only on the stay home part. I get yelled at but dissatisfied customer for 8 hours straight and I think it is getting to my mental health.

Samantha Mapuranga,"I've been in a relationship with a guy for 2yrs and some months now and i haven't met his parents cuz they live in a different country. We've had series of arguments  here and there in the relationship and he holds me  responsible for all of them. I do admit that when i get upset i can be abit careless with word. Im the kind of person that always try to be cheerful and if something or someone  bothers me i always want to clear the air by discussing the problem, well my boyfriend seems to think that i don't have a good choice of words wen it comes to speaking, but i think I'm just brutally honest. Well there was a time when him and iwere having a discussion with some of his cousins and they were talking about how women submit to men and how men shuld dominate in the house hold.Since some of the societies we live in are still patriarchal, i simply made a remark that won't suffer in the hands of a man and I'm getting educated to be independent. Understand me what i said wasn't bad cuz nowadays women should be independent but they took it the wrong way,apparently they saw it as rebellion and concluded that I'd be a nonsubmissive wife. This incident  happened a year ago then earlier today we had alil misunderstanding and he brought it up saying that i its been weighing heavy on his heart and he had to say it. Then he also said that he should have listened to his parents when they cautioned him that he persue a girl whose nt from the same community something like that. 4 me this meant that he hadn't been sure bwt the relationship for quite a while yet he kept seeing me knowing that he doesn't really see a future with me. With all these thots going thru my head i started thinking y he failed 2 mention this before i invested mo than 2 yrs of my life into a relationship. My emotions R evrywhr and i don't know if holding is still an option 4 me.I've literally changed alot of things about me 2 make the relationship work but now confused if im in love or afraid of starting

Sandun Lakwin,"Im a 24 m. I have anxiety and mild depression. I have some self esteem issues as well. Im a people pleaser and Im currently working on that. I was first diagnosed when  I was 19. I read lot of self help books and it really helped me to identify my situation. I come from a very dysfunctional family. Mom is negligent, highly critical, verbally, emotionally abusive. Dad have some narcissistic qualities too. He refuse to fix the family dynamics by taking things to his own hands. I have been betrayed and emotionally bullied constantly by them. My big brother is very narcissistic, bullying and abusive. He is totally jealous and envious. He has always been that abusive since I was a kid. I had no one to talk to. I still easily get hurt by them. In this house We dont talk about feelings, emotions, love, relationships etc.
Over the past few years my academic performance dropped significantly. Im not willing to dropout from law college. I still fail the exams no matter how hard I study. I'll be having my finals next month. Im very stressed and anxious. Last year I decided to move out, stayed separately but they were very unsupportive. With the pandemic I had to come back to house. My gf is very supportive and understanding. Im trying my best to be independent and move out from this hell. Any help??"

But now that I’ve got a new job, my supervisor has been on my back  for no clear reason. I’ve been doing the work well so I don’t see why she’d overreact and shout when I’ve actually lightened the workload. I’m afraid to go to work now and if I don’t work, my parents will be on my back as well. How do I deal with this? What do I do?"

Rici,what’s going on with me If anyone can help me even a little bit that would be so much appreciated because I’ve been trying to get help for a while now I still speak to my clinician but I don’t have a psychologist I don’t have a therapist and I don’t have anyone to be helping me or telling me what is going on I can’t even go to the hospital because it would take months to even get into a hospital for someone to help I can’t even get evaluated for a year and I really need help so here’s what my issue is :I lost myself numerous times do to negative life situations and I was in Cults so I changed many times and I lost myself I recently got diagnosed with bipolar two OCD and health anxiety and I started taking medication for it I started thinking that I got myself back I remember being 14 I loved Netflix scary movies make up and other stuff and I remember that summer when I was 14 I didn’t really use my phone and I didn’t talk to anyone so I was by myself just chilling that whole summer and so I felt really comfortable and I see that to this day knowing that I was comfortable at that age and I was doing. Stuff that I liked and I liked the person that I was. So recently I noticed I was very upset because I’ve been going through a lot and I just got back set a time where I was literally watching Netflix the whole summer and I just said I literally need to do that again And just be my myself until I figure that all up and shortly after I started like a make up again and all this other stuff I did like when I was 14 and I was thinking well it’s too good to be true I cannot just be all of a sudden be myself again. This must be fake and I noticed that as I kept doing these things that I used to do that I like like watching TV scary movies doing my make up doing stuff that I liked in the past I constantly have flashbacks of me doing that years ago and so I kind of forget that I am in reality and I am in the present and that’s why I’m kind of worried that it’s not real and I’m just tricking myself and I think that I don’t really like these things because of the fact that high constantly or often keep remembering the past and yes it is comforting but at the same time I want to be in the present not in the past not having daydreams of the past when everything was easy and this all started when I started taking my medication for bipolar because I just got diagnosed with it so I thought that was a good thing meaning I started being myself again after being not treated for bipolar for a long time and so I just can’t figure out what’s going on this is a little conclusion I came to but again I don’t know psychology that well so I need someone to help me here’s the conclusion: I think the person who I was when I was 14 is the only part of me I liked so that’s what I wanna be . And I want to be that because I tried spirituality I tried religion and I tried other stuff that didn’t work for me and I hated myself The only part of myself I didn’t hate was my 14 year old self if I try and let her go I will not be comfortable I will be confused bc what if I still like makeup and movies and all the other stuff but I trick myself into not liking it thinking I’m just tryna be 14 again that’s the conclusion I came to and again I am bipolar so I could switch moods feelings and other stuff very quickly and I can dissociate from myself very quickly as well and literally not like anything that I was doing for example I can literally love A certain song or a genre of music and then all of a sudden I think that I don’t like it anymore and five minutes later oh yeah I still do like it and same thing with my sexuality so it is frustrating and right now after coming to that conclusion I feel dissociated for myself so then again I do not know if who I was being a couple minutes before I questioned who I am about the whole thing I just wrote what is the real me because I feel dissociated I feel empty I do not feel happy and I cannot tell what to do because I love the person that I was being and I have OCD too so I constantly doubt myself in question myself and I just don’t know what to do

Julie Clark,"I have been having a lot of medical problems lately and it got to me a lot. I still don't know what's happening with me (undiagnosed and doctors don't care much) , I just know that I feel physically worse as days go on and of course it's taken the toll on my mental health. I don't want to wake up in the near future and hear the words that I don't have much left on this world and that terrifies me. I'm only 22. I still want to do so much with my life. I want to do so so so much more. 
I can't function properly anymore. Every pain, lump or sensation leads me to the fact that I have something sinister that's growing and happening rapidly. There isn't a day where I don't cry. Most days I just lay in bed searching from what will I die now because my doctor doesn't take me seriously. I don't have any motivation left,no passions and nothing to strive for anymore.I'm just done with everything."

Juno Guinevere Cullen,"I'm tired of life. Tired of even getting up in the morning. Since I was a kid I learned that people can never be trusted. I was once a loving and gentle human being until I got fed up of nonstop, repetitive crap of me being taken for granted. Then I just learned through the years that it's in human nature that we all just use each other to survive and get through things.
My bottom line is that why we try so hard in life getting hurt, getting lied on, taking us for granted, etc when at the end of the day, no matter how good or bad your life is, we all die and that's it. 
I'm tired of society and people. 
I just want to go out and get over with this life.
I'm looking for answers and I'm tired of toxic positivity crap like be grateful of what we have, there are other people who suffer far worst than me and all of that stuff..I need answers.. i hope someone can enlighten me. I'm really tired and anytime I guess I'll get over with it.

Rebecca Kitchens Vance,"Should it be a big deal if you find a porn dvd titled ""Teens"" in your 43 yr old husband's stuff? I literally got sick to my stomach when I saw it. I confronted him with it and all he could say was he didn't remember having it and it was given to him 15 years or more ago from a guy he worked with. He said I was making it into something over nothing.My question to him was, why did you ever accept it to begin with even 15 yrs ago?He has always had porn at home and it doesn't ever bother me but when it's titled ""Teens"" that's a whole other ball game to me. Am I wrong for thinking that way?"

Chris Ridgeway,"What causes a mother to be so evil? It’s like my mother tries to intentionally hurt us… I’m the oldest of three… But it’s not just her children it is her mother to… She takes care of her mother but every day talks very down to her and makes her miserable… She also does this to her children, There is nothing good that she ever says… For example I broke my leg some months back...badly.. and had to move in with her I pay what she asks and pretty much stay to myself… I’ve told her for sometime now but when the income tax checks come in I will be moving out again… I still can’t walk and I’m still unable to work and that’s why I’m waiting For the checks to come in… The other day she sends me a text message saying I need to be out by certain date which just happens to be a few weeks before the checks will come out and she knows this… What causes a person to be like that much less to her own children it’s not just me she’s like that too… She is always miserable and she is always trying to project on her children and her mother she wants everybody around her to be miserable… She will intentionally pick a fight and if you ignore her she will continue… She also will put out of her mind anything that does not go with her opinions...And I really do not understand why can anybody help

Poura Haha,"I hope this will be allowed by adminI feel like I don't know myself because I'm such a people-pleaser. I've watched multiple videos about ""How to stop caring about what people think about you"" and the tips and advices were useful, but after months, I realized that I'm more affected when people don't think about me, I get really insecure when nobody cares about me, I feel like I'm an attention seeker so I'll do everything I can to impress anyone and gain attention. If I don't, I get really depressed. I wanna know how to solve this because it's really affecting me."

Sandie Rose,"I had an emotional support dog that recently passed away and I didn’t think the pain would ever ease up to be tolerable, then I was blessed with 2 rescues from a kill shelter and I brought home and immediately the harassment and intimidation and fear of their intentions started again from residents in my apartment building for elderly and disabled adults.  I went threw it with my previous dog too.  They make false accusations and have meetings and sign petitions to have my dogs removed.  I know if they succeed I can’t live on my own my anxiety and depression will overcome me.    Anyone have any suggestions or advice for me... I’m on day 5 now absolutely no sleep and I need relief from this torment."
Debo Dutta,"I had a partner who was not my boyfriend and we didn't exactly feel that way but we were very close and agreed to not see other people, also because he was going through a breakup. But later he went and made a girlfriend and I was very hurt because he didn't actually cheat on me but did betray me. I was so jealous. They broke up within a month and then he pleaded that  we become friends again. After four months of this, I finally started talking with him normally. He said he didn't wanna ruin what we had by making me his girlfriend and just was out of his mind because his previous ex kept bugging him and making his life miserable. Now our relationship has become like I don't treat him nicely. He apologized me a lot for that incident but I don't act sane with him. Its been over a year since I have been toxic with him. I am not a toxic person but when with him, I become this way. Now finally, we have stopped talking and its been a couple days. 
I miss him so much. Is it my fault? Do i forgive him? Do I move on? I have no clue. Please I need some advice guys."

Azra Manaz,A favour.  A boy was 19 years old.  He was falling love with a girl and completed his all the sexual urges or libidos with her many times.  But his love was broken up. But now his past sexual life is triggering  him. He totally upset.  He can't control his sexual feelings and his past sexual incidents. And sometimes he uses masturbation too. He couldn't concentrate his daily activities. He asks whether how to overcome from this?

Im letting other people see that im happy but every night i cry silent by myself. I dont know what to do. Im so tired.
